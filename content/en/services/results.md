## Methylation Based Prediction

### Interpretation
- **PAAD**, **iCCA**, **Normal Bile**, or **No Match**

### NN Score
- **Match for carcinomas** when >= 0.8
- **Match for normal tissue** when >= 0.6

- **No match for carcinomas** when < 0.8
- **No match for normal tissue** when < 0.6

*`No match` scores could potentially still be relevant if the tumor purity or DNA quality are low.*

### Anomaly Detection Layer
- **Pass** - Samples that passed this layer are recognized as PAAD, iCCA, and Normal Bile.
- **Reject** - Rejected samples should be reassessed for other types of carcinomas.
