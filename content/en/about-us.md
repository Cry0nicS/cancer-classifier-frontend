# Who We Are

This website was established by Dr. Dragomir and T.G. Calina to provide access to the models published in their research. Our goal is to make these tools accessible to other researchers interested in testing them. We believe our tool can be highly useful in specific cases and aim to simplify its usage.

The website is hosted and developed by T.G. Calina as a personal project, not affiliated with any institution. Currently, the infrastructure costs are low enough to be covered within the free tier of our cloud service provider, which may result in slower predictions and a limited number of samples processed simultaneously.

In the future, any increase in costs due to higher traffic will be covered privately by T.G. Calina. This is a pro-bono effort with no commercial interests, aimed solely at supporting the research community.

We review potential users before granting access to the tool to prevent resource abuse and ensure users understand the results produced by the tool.
